**MB-MVPA** is a unified Python fMRI analysis tool to find a brain implementation of a latent behavioral state.
It combines two fMRI analytic frameworks: *model-based fMRI* and *multi-voxel pattern anlysis (MVPA)*, which is
featured by replacing a massive univariate analysis with MVPA. MB-MVPA provides simple executable functions to conduct 
computational modeling (supported by *hBayesDM*_[1]), and run model-based MVPA. 

MB-MVPA supports Python 3.6 or above and relies on NumPy, NiLearn, hBayesDM, py-glmnet, and tensorflow (version)
